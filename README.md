# Space Invaders

A simple space invaders clone made with Js using de P5.js library

## How to play

The game is very simple, it's designed to look precisely like the original game, but it's still under development (when I have time to, sadly)

To move the ship, use the left and right arrow keys. Up and down movement is not supported.
To shoot, just strike your beautiful spacebar, and watch the little green men suffer

The game ends either when the aliens come to your ship to kidnap your crew and laugh at your horrible battle skills, or when you kill all the
aliens with your powerful laser gun! The speed of the aliens grow for each alien you kill, emulating the original behaviour of the game ([did you
know](https://www.looper.com/293293/details-you-didnt-know-about-space-invaders/) it was originally a glitch? The more aliens were on
the screen, the more the game became slow due to processing limitations)

## How to run

It's Javascript! Just download it and run in any browser! (Wait, not *any* browser. Be sure to don't use any dinossaur with low Js support, please)

That's it, enjoy and have fun :D
